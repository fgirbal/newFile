# newFile
Simplifies the process of creating a new file in Matlab with an adequate header template (file + author information).

## Requirements
- A computer with at least Matlab R2012a (tested in R2016a)

## Installing
Download and run `newFile.mlappinstall`.

## Running

In the first run, you must input your information in the **Author Info** section and save it (preferably to your default directory). After this, you can simply run `newFile` anywhere and it will automatically fill in this information for you.
